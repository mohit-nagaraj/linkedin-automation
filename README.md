Python-based LinkedIn lead finder and connector for software dev/founder personas. It:

- Logs into LinkedIn, searches people by your keywords with **pagination support**
- **Filters by connection status** - only processes unconnected profiles
- Scrapes comprehensive profile info (name, position, headline, location, about, experiences, education, skills, followers)
- **Smart duplicate detection** - updates existing profiles instead of creating duplicates
- Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate a concise profile summary and a personalized 280-char connect note
- Sends a connection request with note (with test mode available)
- Stores leads into Google Sheets with **enhanced table structure** for better tracking
- **Respects MAX_PROFILES limit** - stops processing after reaching your specified limit

Note: Automating LinkedIn may violate their Terms. Use responsibly and at your own risk.
