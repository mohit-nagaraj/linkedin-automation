# linkedin-automation

Python-based LinkedIn lead finder and connector for software dev/founder personas. It:

- Logs into LinkedIn, searches people by your keywords
- Scrapes visible profile info (name, headline, location, about, top experiences, skills, followers)
- Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to generate a concise profile summary and a personalized 280-char connect note
- Sends a connection request with note
- Stores leads into Google Sheets so you can review on mobile

Note: Automating LinkedIn may violate their Terms. Use responsibly and at your own risk.
